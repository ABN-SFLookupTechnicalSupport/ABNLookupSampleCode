Very basic example of using ABN Lookup Service with Ruby on Rails.  The purpose is to show how to integrate the service using the SOAP4R gem.

Requirements:

SOAP4R GEM
'gem install soap4r --include-dependencies'

Navigate to localhost:3000/abn_lookup/

NOTE:
- There is no error checking.  If a ABN number doesn't have an associated trading name then a nil object will be acted on, thus producing a no method error.  You should integrate this checking into the model or controller, depending upon its use in the application.
